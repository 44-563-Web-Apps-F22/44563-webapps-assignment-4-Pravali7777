    Upon my word, this is most curious—  most absurdly
    whimsical. Five-and-a-quarter!  No one would think it
    to look at me!</p>

    You are glad now, I'll be bound, that you spared us.
    You would never have forgiven yourself when you
    discovered that you had killed two of your comrades.</p>

    My comrades?</p>

    I'm afraid you don't appreciate the delicacy
    of your position:   You were apprenticed to us—</p>

    Until I reached my twenty-first year.</p>

    No, until you reached your twenty-first birthday
    (producing document), and, going by birthdays, you are
    as yet only five-and-a-quarter.</p>

    You don't mean to say you are going to hold me to that?</p>
    <h6 class="kin">KIN</h6>
    <h6 class="speech"></h6>
    No, we merely remind you of the fact, and leave the
    rest to your sense of duty.</p>
    <h6 class="rut">RUT</h6>
    <h6 class="speech"></h6>
    Your sense of duty!</p>

    Don't put it on that footing!  As I was
    merciful to you just now, be merciful to me!  I implore
    you not to insist on the letter of your bond just as
    the cup of happiness is at my lips!</p>
